User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to be able to sign-up in order to keep track of my meditation sessions.
2. As a user, I want to be able to sign-in in order to keep track of my meditations sessions.
3. As a user, I want to be able to sign-out so that my sessions reflect only me.
4. As a user I want to see my meditation sessions, in order to see how I have been practicing.
5. As a user I want to be able to delete a session in case I feel like I don't want that one counted.
6. As a user I want to be able to create a session so that I can reference it in my app later.
7. As a user I want ot be ablet to update a session so that I can change the time length in case I meditated longer or shorter.


Future Problems to Fix:
1) I want to add a timer and a clock so that you can create the sessions
as a user while you're meditating rather than logging a session after you time yourself.
2) I would also like to add more styling and star wars styling to complete that connection.

Strategy:
I wanted to create a meditation application for people to pretend to be jedi and just simply log their sessions in the application so that the user could look back on how well they stuck to their goals or schedule. I began by picking up a React template to get started with and connecting it to my API created with Python and Django Framework. I really wanted to challenge myself to use these technologies since they are relatively new to myself. After that I created 2 routes on my api to handle creating, updating, deleting, and reading my resource (a session). After that I created 3 components within React that handle the CRUD actions of my resource. I then added some styling to connect the jedi user experience. Getting around bugs was simply data transfer problem solving. I utilized console.log() quite a bit to make sure I was sharing data around the project correctly.
